# Rails CRUD with 5 Song App
Let's create a full crud rails app that displays 5 songs in a table on the home page. We're going to use a PostgreSQL database today.
```
rails new <app-name> -T -d postgresql
```
**note**: `<app-name>` is a required name. You can choose what to put, eg: `five_songs`

## Generate a Song Model
Let's start by generating a song model with the following attributes: title, artist, album, and youtube link. You may notice that all of these attributes are strings. By default, rails uses the string datatype for model attributes, so we do not need to explicitly state the datatype in our model generation. However, we will.  
```
rails generate model song title:string artist:string album:string youtube_link:string
```
That is, this would be the exact same thing as the above statement
```
rails generate model song title artist album youtube_link
```
If we want to be able to create new songs, we must first make sure that
we have a database, and that we have run our migrations.
```
bin/rake db:create db:migrate
```
Now, we should be able to hop into rails console and create some songs.
Before we do this, let's add the [hirb gem](https://github.com/cldwalker/hirb) to our Gemfile.
```ruby
# ...
  group :development do
    # ...
    gem 'hirb'
    # ...
  end
# ...
```
Let's hop into `rails console` and create a song.
```
rails console
song = Song.new
song.title = "Heavy Metal"
song.artist = "White Rabbits"
song.album = "Milk Famous"
song.youtube_link = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8Rk2lDZJhU"
song.save
```
We can also create songs in one step, like this:
```
Song.create(title: "Heavy Metal", artist: "White Rabbits", album: "Milk Famous", youtube_link: "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8Rk2lDZJhU")
```
